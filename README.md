# Node-Express-Handlebars


# Description
- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
- Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
- Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
